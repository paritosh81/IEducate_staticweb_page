            <p class="text-small 'Section-subtag"> online learning is a part of many institutions' course offerings around the world. From certificates, PhDs, impactful online language learning and everything in between, learning online has never been so easy!

                Offered by some of the world's top-ranked institutions, online learning offers you all the perks of attending your dream university, with the added convenience of a learning experience tailored to your schedule.  With courses available in almost every subject, and flexible timetables to suit almost every lifestyle, students are increasingly turning to online learning as a viable alternative to on-campus study. It could allow you to study abroad remotely, at a university not in your home country!
                
                Advances in technology now allow students to study entirely online while still socializing with classmates, watching lectures and participating in subject-specific discussions.
                
                While some consider online learning to require a greater degree of self-motivation, institutions recognize that educational support is just as important as tutor feedback, and take great care to ensure that their students receive the same levels of support that they would receive on campus.The Facts and Figures About Online Learning

                More than 6 million students are currently in online courses as part of their higher education program
                Almost half of all students enrolled in online courses are educated exclusively through distance education
                85% of students think that online learning is the same or better than the traditional classroom experience

                Resources for Online Learning
                In general, when taking an online degree program you might encounter resources like: 
                
                EBooks;
                Journals;
                Videos;
                Recorded lectures;
                Quizzes;
                Discussion forums
                Live Q&A sessions; and
                Interviews.
                The resources offered to you for learning online will depend on the institution where you take your online program. Some online learning programs may require you to order physical textbooks in advance by in the mail, but these are generally being phased out in favor of eBooks and online-only methods of delivery. </p>

            <p class="text-small 'Section-subtag">For those institutions that have made the transition to using 100% online resources, students can expect to study using a combination of cutting-edge technological resources with no need to travel to attend lectures, exams or in-person discussion sessions!

                Taking an online learning program, you'll be an officially registered student at your institution and have access to the same resources as an on-campus student, like your institution's digital library, learning management system (like Blackboard), student union membership and more! An online degree is similar to taking a degree program on campus, but you have the freedom to direct your own study schedule. 
                
                Your school and your course instructor will determine the format for each individual course and will select delivery methods that are best suited to your course or program. What a Biology major needs to learn successfully online will differ from what an Art History major needs! 
                
                Online learning may be a completely new experience for you. If you're coming from a more traditional learning background, read on to discover how to make the most of the resources you may encounter in your online learning journey!  
                
                eBooks, textbooks & journals
                These written materials are essential resources in almost every course you'll take when learning online.
                
                Using the reading list for each course, or on the advice of your course instructor, you'll need to dedicate the amount of time you need to reading and understanding the topics in the literature. The main advantage of using this medium (particularly eBooks) is the fact that they are completely portable, allowing you to study on the go from your computer, phone or tablet. 
                
                Pro tip:
                
                When you’re researching a course or program, remember to check whether your textbooks are included in your tuition fees! You may have to pay extra for your textbooks, or they may be available as eBooks from your institution's library. 
                
                Recorded lectures
                An essential way of absorbing a large amount of information in a relatively short amount of time, lectures are a staple of online and campus-based learning. With online learning, you can attend lectures from your bedroom! 
                
                Pro tip:
                
                If you can, make notes throughout your lectures; this will make it easier to review for exams, and any assignments you'll need to complete throughout your course. 
                
                Interactive sessions
                The greatest challenge an online education provider faces is how to replicate the face-to-face interaction and in-person discussions that on-campus institutions can easily provide.
                
                The solution? Online degree programs often use a combination of discussion forums and interactive question-and-answer sessions to give you the interaction with other students and instructors you need. 
                
                Pro tip:
                
                Before beginning an online discussion forum or interactive session, make sure you read the rules and requirements; some institutions may require you to create posts that have a minimum word count.

            <p class="text-small 'Section-subtag">Online Learning and Employment 
                Once you have an in-depth understanding of how your qualifications earned online are recognized in your country, you'll be able to plan how you'll talk about your online learning experience to employers! 
                
                Many employers make no differentiation between online degrees and degrees earned on campus - as long as your qualifications are recognized in your field. For some employers, gaining your qualifications online will provide you with a unique skill set to help you stand out from the crowd of other applicants.
                
                Students considering online study should not be deterred by old-fashioned ideas about ‘real’ degrees only being awarded by campus-based institutions. In fact, many employers now recognize that studying online (and part-time) takes a large amount of dedication and commitment. The passion and drive needed to achieve your qualifications online are characteristics of many star employees across industries. 
                
                Think studying for an online degree is something uncommon? Think again; the latest statistics show that around 33% of college students are taking at least one course online and “eventually, one-third of college students expect to study online, one-third expect to study only on campus, and one-third will do both.” This increased participation will naturally lead to increased recognition of online learning. Furthermore, there is a 71% expected increase in online enrolments overall. An important aspect that determines the quality of a study experience is the level of support that students receive. Many students worry that online institutions will not be able to provide the support that they need. This concern is increasingly being recognized by online learning providers, and many are working hard to ensure that students’ needs are met in all areas.

                The main concern that potential students have regarding support is the lack of face-to-face help that an online course provides; however, by using technology like video calling and  the more traditional phone and email, virtual institutions are increasingly bridging the gap between online and on-campus student support.
                
                Student Support Teams
                A dedicated Student Support team often forms the core of online institutions' student support functions. The sole responsibility of this team is to provide pastoral care and support. Online (and part-time) students can experience problems and issues that are unique to this mode of study, and online learning institutions' Student Support teams will be experienced and sympathetic to the range of issues experienced by online learners.</p>
